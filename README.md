# Online Shop with a cart (React with Redux)

## About
 ** Project is based on my previous project (https://github.com/JustinaJur/myShop). This project is different in respect to data flow that is implemented here by REDUX, not by React itself.**

This is an online shop with few pages. In one - there is a list products to be ordered, in another - a cart (list and quantity of products, total price). In both pages products can be searched. Website is completely responsive, renders well on screens of different sizes.

## Technologies
Project is made with: React, Redux, HTML, CSS GRID

## Setup
